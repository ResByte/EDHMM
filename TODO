Inference
=========
 - how do we choose which alpha_t to calculate in the forward recursion?is it just those requested by the sum at t+1?
 - how do we initialise the forward recursion?
 - how is u taken into account in the backward recursion

Results
=======
 - model with same emission distributions but different durations
 - model with same duration distributions but different emissions
 - model with drastically varying durations?
 - application to T-Cells
